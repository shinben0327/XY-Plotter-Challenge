# XY-Plotter-Challenge

Generates a G-code to plot a given image on a 2D plane. 

Makes use of the [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv "OpenCV") library for image processing, 
and the [mecode](https://github.com/jminardi/mecode "mecode") library for generating and exporting G-code. 

Created as part of the X-Y Plotter Challenge organised by the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI).
